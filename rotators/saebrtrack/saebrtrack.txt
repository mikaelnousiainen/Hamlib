I wanted to use Hamlib with my Amsat Tricked-Out WRAPS satellite antenna
rotator [1],[2] with Hamlib and gpredict. During testing I discovered that the
 WARPS implementation of EASYCOMM I rotator protocol is not correct.

The EASYCOMM I specification states "The Az and El values (aaa.a and eee.e)
are not fixed width."

The WRAPS EASYCOMM implementation is FIXED WIDTH! The WRAPS does not work with
Hamlib's correct implementation of the EASYCOMM protocol.

WARPS is expecting a zero padded number for the Az and El values. Leading
zeros need to be added.
Example for Az of 99 and El of 10:
WARPS:
 AZ099.0 EL010.0 UP000 XXX DN000 XXX
EASYCOMM I:
 AZ99.0 EL10.0 UP000 XXX DN000 XXX

The SAEBRTrack rotator backend is a hack of the Hamlib EASYCOMM rotator
backend. I copied EASYCOMM backend and removed what was not needed.

I named the Hamlib rotator backend SAEBRTrack because that is the rotator
protocol that is used with the WRAPS in the Microsoft windows pcsat32 program.

The SAEBRTrack rotator backend only supports changing the rotor's Az and El.

I have tested the rotator backend for Az and El changes with my Amsat WRAPS.

The backend should work with original SAEBRTrack [3] and derivatives.

The specification of EASYCOMM I protocol the are in the easycomm.txt file in
the EASYCOMM rotator backend source directory
